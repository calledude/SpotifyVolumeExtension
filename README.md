# SpotifyVolumeExtension
Makes Windows respect volume-button input when Spotify is running.

Since Windows refuses to recognize when other programs that use the media buttons might be running, I decided to fix that.
This is a simple program that will allow you to change your Spotify-volume when it is running, with your media keys.

Let's rise up against Windows and take back control of our media keys! *Viva La RÃ©sistance*!
